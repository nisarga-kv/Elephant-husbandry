Captive elephants in Indiaâ€™s North Eastern Region face critical challenges due to outdated husbandry practices, poor disease surveillance, and fragmented stakeholder coordination. Traditional methods fail to leverage emerging technologies for timely health interventions or sustainable care. Moreover, the exclusion of rural women and Self-Help Groups (SHGs)despite their deep traditional knowledge limits community-based conservation efforts. Our proposed solution, GajaSetu addresses these gaps through an IoT-enabled Elephant Husbandry System that integrates real-time monitoring of elephant health, behavior, and habitat conditions using wearable sensors, automated feeding, and smart showers. A centralized dashboard enhances veterinary planning, while multilingual mobile apps train and empower SHG members to become active caretakers and eco-tourism facilitators. This initiative enables early disease detection and intervention, significantly improving elephant health and survival. Simultaneously, it uplifts rural women by providing technical training, employment, and leadership roles in elephant care and sustainable livelihoods. Eco-friendly innovations like biogas systems and solar-powered devices reinforce environmental sustainability. GajaSetu thus presents a scalable, inclusive, and tech-driven model that not only improves disease control and management but also drives sustainable elephant husbandry while empowering marginalized communities. By bridging technology with tradition, the project creates a holistic, ethical, and resilient care ecosystem for elephants and their human stewards.
